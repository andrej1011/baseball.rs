# Baseball.rs - Central Hub for Serbian Baseball

_Final Project for Software Lab 2: Web Design_
## 
**Developed by** Andrej Rajkov

**University Course:** Software Lab 2 (Web Design) at Faculty of Sciences, University of Novi Sad

## ⚾️ Project Overview

**Baseball .rs** was conceived as the central online hub for the Serbian baseball community. Since baseball in Serbia operates largely underground, the goal of this website was to provide a professional, accessible, and comprehensive resource for both dedicated fans and new participants.

The project fulfilled the requirements for the "Software Lab 2 - Web Design" course, demonstrating expertise in responsive design, information architecture, and modern front-end development techniques.
